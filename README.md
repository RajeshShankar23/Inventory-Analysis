# Business Problem
In this case study, you will use a dataset from a company called WarmeHands Incorporated. The task is to analyse the inventory data and give some insights into which would be the best items for renewing or increasing inventory. Inventory analysis is a management technique that can help you optimize inventory control. For instance, it can help you reduce storage expenses, item costs, and unused goods and to increase profit. There are many ways to do inventory analysis, but for this case study a basic approach will be used.

# Approach Used:

The inventory analytics report for WarmeHands Incorporated begins with an initial data cleaning phase followed by the calculation of key metrics such as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Revenue_2020, and Profit_2020. These metrics provide insights into the financial performance of the company in 2020.

Further analysis involves exploring average COGS per item, revenue, and profit by category, highlighting significant variations between categories. Preliminary insights reveal the top-selling items, such as "Grow a Flytrap or Sunflower," and the most profitable categories, like Home Accessories.

The report then delves into more detailed calculations, including average inventory, inventory turnover, and ABC analysis. Average inventory and turnover metrics provide insights into inventory management efficiency, while ABC analysis classifies items based on their revenue contribution.

A comparison between 2020 and 2021 performances reveals shifts in revenue percentages for top-selling items, such as "The Set of 6 Soldier Skittles," indicating changes in consumer preferences or market conditions.

The ABC analysis suggests discontinuing low-value items to streamline the product assortment and allocate resources more efficiently. Additionally, insights from COGS to revenue ratio analysis help guide purchasing decisions, recommending increasing inventory for high-profit items like "Woodland Charlotte Bag."
